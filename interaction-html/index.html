  <h1>THE SECRET (RHONDA BYRNE)</h1>
<div class="main">
    <p><big>THE <span class="special">SECRET <img class="special-img one" src="Secret.jpg"></span> REVEALED</big></p>
    <p>Everything that’s coming in your <span class="special">life<img class="special-img two" src="life.jpg"></span> you are attracting into your life. And it’s attracted to you
by virtue of images you are holding in your mind. It’s what you are thinking. Whatever is going
on in your mind you are attracting to you.</p>
    <p>Charles Hanel: The greatest and the most in fallible <span class="special">law<img class="special-img three" src="law.jpg"></span> upon which the entire system of
creation depends. </p>
    <p>The predominant thought or mental attitude is a <span class="special">magnet<img class="special-img four" src="magnet.jpg"></span> and it will invariably attract such
conditions as correspond to its nature.</p>
    <p>John Assaraf: You become what you think about most, but you also attract what you think
about most. Thoughts has a frequency.</p>
    <p>Here is the problem. Most people are thinking about what they don’t want, and they are
wondering why it shows up again and again. It’s a “don’t want” epidemic.</p>
    <p>You are a transmission <span class="special">tower<img class="special-img five" src="tower.png"></span>, and you are transmitting that frequency with your thoughts!</p>
    <p>If you want to change anything in your life, change your thoughts.</p>
    <p>Bob Proctor: See yourself living in abundance and you will attract it. It works every time, with
every person.</p>
    <p>Bob Doyle: The law of attraction doesn’t care whether you perceive something to be good or
bad, or whether you don’t want it or whether you do want it</p>
    <p><span class="special">You don’t press pause, you don’t press stop.<img class="special-img six" src="stop.jpg"></span> It is forever in action, as your thoughts are.
Creation is always happening. Something is going to manifest out of those thoughts. It creates
your future life.</p>
    <p>What you think about the most or focus on the most, is what will appear in your life.</p>
    <p>If you are complaining, or sympathising with someone doing it, you attract more of that in your
life.</p>
    <p>Your life is in your hands, No matter where you are now, no matter what happened in your life,
you can begin to consciously choose your thoughts, and can change your life. There is no such
thing as hopeless situation. Every single circumstance of your life can change!</p>
    <p>You attract to you the predominant thoughts that you are holding in your
awareness(conscious/unconscious).</P>
    <p>When you become aware, you wake up from a deep sleep.</p>
    <p>Your life is a mirror of the dominant thoughts you think. Use your free will to choose your
thoughts and change your life.</p>
    <p>Affirmative thoughts are 100 times more powerful than negative ones. Scientifically proven.
But believe that.</p>
    <p>Thank God that there is a time delay, that all your thoughts don’t come true instantly. This
serves you well to reassess, to think about what you want, and to make a new choice.</p>
    <p>One way to master your mind is to learn to quiet your mind. Every great person meditates daily.
It helps control thoughts and revitalizes body. Just 3-10 minutes a day to begin with are
sufficient.</p>
    <p>To become aware of your thoughts, you can set the intention. “I am master of my thoughts”.
Say it often, meditate on it.</p>

    <p><big>HOW TO USE THE SECRET</big></P>
    <p><span class="highlight">Ask:<span class="first">Sit down and write it out on paper in a present tense. “I am so happy and grateful now that---
“. And then explain how you want your life to be, in every area. You must be clear about what
you want Otherwise it doesn’t work. Make a habit to ask. If you don’t know which way to go,
ask! Don’t ask for the same thing again and again.</span></span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Believe:</p>
    <p>Believe that it is already yours. Have unwavering faith. Know that they will come at you at
need. Don’t fret and worry about them. Don’t think about the lack of them. You must act,
speak, and thin, as though you are receiving it now. Start make believing. Have undying faith.
You don’t need to know how it’s going to come about. If it takes time, don’t get frustrated and
doubtful. </p>
    <p>Receive:</p>
    <p>Begin to feel wonderful about it. Feel it now.
Whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
You can start with nothing, and out of nothing and out of no way, a way will be made.
Think of the car driving at night. Headlights can show you only 100 feet of road, and still you
can drive 100s of km distance safely. Take the first step in faith. You don’t have to see the whole universe. Just take the 1st step. You
don’t have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step.You must feel good right now. This is important. If you are not feeling good, you can’t attract
good to you. If you want to make your body fit, praise and bless every square inch of your
body. While eating focus on enjoying the experience of chewing the food. Feel the taste. Be
completely be focussed in the present moment. The benefits of food are best with this.</p>
    <p>Create Your day in Advance:</p>
    <p>When you say ‘i am going to have a pleasant visit or journey’, you are sending elements and
forces ahead to arrange it that way.We always complain that we don’t have enough time. Things then happen that way. That
increases stress and we chase time. Instead, declare emphatically, “I have more than enough
time”, and change your life.You can also turn waiting period into a powerful time to create your future life. Imagine having
all things you want. You can do it anywhere, anytime. Turn every life situation into a positive
one!Make it a habit to determine every event in your life in advance through thoughs.</p>
